# Codecademy_Portfolio
A codecademy python portfolio project which involved manipulating a csv file of insurance costs to assess the dataset, calculate the average costs, the average costs for smokers and non smokers etc.

Portfolio projects conducted as part of the codecademy datascience career path. 

Please note, the raw data for the jeopardy project was too large to include in the repository, however the code I've written is still included and can be 
downloaded.
